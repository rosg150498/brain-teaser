## Project Goals and Target Audience

Welcome to BrainTeaser. The goal of BrainTeaser is to give players a fun and challenging way to test their knowledge and ability to answer as many questions as they can. The quiz should be fun to take and rewarding to users as they progress throughout the questions. BrainTeaser's intended players can be of any age range but primarily to those who have a passion for trivia and interesting topics. Also, individuals who are looking for a mental challenge and entertainment at the same time would be a great fit for BrainTeaser, particularly those who enjoy testing their knowledge, and competing with others.
